    "question": "What does AI stand for?",
    "options": ["Artificial Intelligence", "Automated Interface", "Advanced Integration"],
    "answer": "Artificial Intelligence",
    "explanation": "AI stands for Artificial Intelligence, which refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines."
  },
